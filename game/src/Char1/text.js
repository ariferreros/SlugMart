I have been doing some reading recommended by this guy in this Facebook group I am a part of. ", "I have been getting all of my workout tips from him recently, but he’s been telling me that the next step forward is to start making real lifestyle changes. I told him I would do whatever it takes!", "This was one of the first things he recommended I try, introducing raw milk into my diet rather than using any of the fake alternatives. I plan on using this with my protein powder to really get the maximum gains.", "This was one of the other most important tips he gave me, NO MORE SEED OILS. I have been making the terrible mistake of using all the wrong oils when I cook my unseasoned chicken and rice when I should have been using tallow all this time. I am done with putting pollutants in my body!"],

I did some further research, and it turns out that drinking raw milk could totally give me sicknesses and stuff. I could not believe it!", " I tried using the beef tallow in place of oils as well for my cooking, and it made me feel terrible before going to the gym. I think I am going to switch out from only using those products the guy mentioned. I want to be able to eat as healthy as possible without getting sick so I am prepared for the gym. I really learned my lesson, maybe not all “health” products are actually good for my diet!"],
